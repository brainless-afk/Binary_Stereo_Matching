# Binary_Stereo_Matching

Implementation of equations 1-4  as described by Zhang et al. (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.2020.pdf) to solve the 
correspondence problem for rectified stereo images with a BRIEF-based binary pattern comparison.

Rectified stereo images from http://vision.middlebury.edu/stereo/data/ .

Use the config file to change parameters of the binary stereo matching algorithm before running.

Example output with Tsukuba dataset:
